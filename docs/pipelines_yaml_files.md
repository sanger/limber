# Pipelines yaml files

There are a number of `*.yml` files located in `config/pipelines/` these
configure the flow of plate purposes through a {Pipeline}. Limber automatically
loads all `.yml` files within this directory into {PipelineList}.
Filenames, and the grouping of pipelines within files, have no functional
relevance, and are intended for organizational reasons.

Loading of yaml files is handled by {ConfigLoader::PipelinesLoader} which
loads all files, detects potential duplicates, and populates the {PipelineList}.

> [!TIP]
> - It is suggested that you create a new file for each new customer 'pipeline'. In most cases this file will actually contain a handful of internal 'pipelines' reflecting branches, or different stages of the process. For example, sample prep followed by library prep.

## An example file

This is an example yaml file configuring a WGS (whole genome sequencing)
pipeline.

```yaml
---
WGS: # Top of the pipeline (Library Prep)
  pipeline_group: WGS
  filters:
    request_type_key:
      - limber_wgs
      - limber_lcmb
      - limber_rnaa
    library_type: Standard
  library_pass: LB Lib PCR-XP
  relationships:
    LB Cherrypick: LB Shear
    LB Shear: LB Post Shear
    LB Post Shear: LB End Prep
    LB End Prep: LB Lib PCR
    LB Lib PCR: LB Lib PCR-XP
WGS MX: # Bottom of the pipeline (Pooling and normalization)
  pipeline_group: WGS
  filters:
    request_type_key:
      - limber_multiplexing
  relationships:
    LB Lib PCR-XP: LB Lib Pool
    LB Lib Pool: LB Lib Pool Norm
```

The rest of the document describes the structure of this file, and what each of the keys do.

## Top level

Each file is a `.yml` file located in `config/pipelines`, it contains the
configuration for one or more {Pipeline pipelines}.

The top level structure consists of series of keys, uniquely identifying each
pipeline. Keys need to be unique across _all_ pipelines, not just those within
the same file. Limber will detect duplicate keys, and will raise an exception
on boot.

The key will be used to set the {Pipeline#name}, this is exposed in the
pipelines overview page, and may get shown to the user in future.

The values in turn are used to describe each {Pipeline}. The valid options are details in Pipeline below.

### Pipeline

Each pipeline configures a name, high-level behaviour and a list of
relationships. As discussed above, the key is a unique value, which gets used
to set the pipeline's name.

@see Pipeline for the Ruby objects generated by this configuration.

```yaml
WGS: # Top of the pipeline (Library Prep)
  pipeline_group: WGS
  filters:
    request_type_key:
      - limber_wgs
      - limber_lcmb
      - limber_rnaa
    library_type: Standard
  library_pass: LB Lib PCR-XP
  relationships:
    LB Cherrypick: LB Shear
    LB Shear: LB Post Shear
    LB Post Shear: LB End Prep
    LB End Prep: LB Lib PCR
    LB Lib PCR: LB Lib PCR-XP
```

The other keys are detailed below.

#### pipeline_group

This groups several Limber pipelines together that are part of the same real world pipeline. 'WGS' in the example above.

For example, pipelines named 'Heron-384 Tailed A V2' and 'Heron-384 Tailed B V2' share
the same pipeline group 'Heron-384 Tailed V2' - the split here is due to the branching PCR chemistry in the pipeline, and there is re-merge of the samples downstream. They are both part of the same Heron customer 'pipeline'.

Another example is when there are separate Limber pipelines for sequential stages. For instance, 'pWGS-384' (the library prep part) and 'pWGS-384 MX' (the multiplexing part). These are both part of the same overall customer 'pipeline', so they both have the pipeline group 'pWGS-384'.

The pipeline group is used in the 'Work in progress' pages and the 'Pipelines overview' page.

#### filters

Filters are use by the code to determine which pipeline a specific instance of Labware is in. This in turn informs the decision on what suggested actions to show the user next. The filters consists of a series of keys, and their acceptable values. Keys should be attributes on {Sequencescape::Api::V2::Request request} (eg. library_type)
whereas values are either an array of acceptable values, or a single acceptable
value.

```yaml
filters:
  request_type_key:
    - limber_wgs
    - limber_lcmb
    - limber_rnaa
  library_type: Standard
```

Indicates that this pipeline can be used for requests with a request type of 'limber_wgs', 'limber_lcmb' or 'limber_rnaa', and a library type of 'Standard'.

The most common keys to filter on are request_type and library_type.

All filters must be fulfilled for a pipeline to be considered valid for the specific instance of Labware in question.
Note that the labware must also have a purpose that matches to one of those listed in the relationships section of the pipeline yaml.
This is partly why we now try to prefix purpose keys with pipeline specific characters, use request types specific to pipeline submission templates, and use library types specific to their library prep pipelines where ever possible.

NB. Care should be taken when choosing purpose names and assigning filters. If you are not careful then a user can be presented with extra green suggested next action buttons in Limber, which are inappropriate for the pipeline they are running. This can cause confusion and potentially support issues if they choose an incorrect option and create the wrong child labware.

For branching pipelines with identical filters, you are strongly encouraged to
use yaml anchors to share the filter between pipelines. See the relationships
section below for more details, and an example.

#### library_pass

library_pass indicates the plate purposes for which the Lims should suggest the
'Charge and Pass Libraries' option. The values should be strings matching purpose names specified in `config/purposes/*.yml`.

It can be a string if library pass should be suggested at a single step:

```yaml
library_pass: LB Lib PCR-XP
```

Or an array, if there are multiple points at which a library can be passed:

```yaml
library_pass:
  - LB Cap Lib PCR-XP
  - LB Cap Lib Pool
```

> [!TIP]
> library_pass usually occurs on the last plate of the pipeline, immediately prior to multiplexing and normalization. This is the point at which the pipeline transitions from the library creation request (eg. limber_wgs) to the multiplexing request (eg. limber_multiplexing). You'll see this reflected in the example above, with the 'WGS' and 'WGS MX' pipelines.
> - This split ensures that customers can request re-pools of existing libraries, without incurring further charges for library creation.
> - It is common, although not necessary, to specify both library_creation and multiplexing sections of a pipeline in the same file.

> library_pass is not specified for the final tube in the WGS MX pipeline because:
> - The behaviour is already handled by passing the tube itself.
> - Multiplexing is not charged for, and rarely failed, so an explicit step is unnecessary and confusing.

#### relationships

The relationships is a hash representing transitions from parent labware to
child labware. Both keys and values are strings matching purpose names specified
in `config/purposes/*.yml`.

```yaml
relationships:
  LB Cherrypick: LB Shear
  LB Shear: LB Post Shear
  LB Post Shear: LB End Prep
  LB End Prep: LB Lib PCR
  LB Lib PCR: LB Lib PCR-XP
```

The above shows a transition from 'LB Cherrypick' to 'LB Shear', 'LB Shear' to 'LB Post Shear' and so on.

Note that generally each relationship leads from one to the next, with the child of one relationship being the parent of the next on the following line. They don't need to be in order like this, but it is easier to understand the flow of the pipeline if it is.

> [!TIP]
> In most Limber pipelines, the final multiplex library tube is created upfront by the limber_multiplexing request. This allows the SSRs to access the sequencing requests easily prior to the completion of library creation, allowing for the addition of removal of requests. A side effect of this is that any Limber pipelines using the standard limber_multiplexing request share the final tube purpose, 'LB Lib Pool Norm'.
> - This is defined in: [`config/purposes/final_tube.yml`](../config/purposes/final_tube.yml)

It should be noted that because the above structure is a hash, it is not possible
to reflect a branching pipeline. Instead, each branch of the pipeline can be
represented by a separate pipeline within the same file.

For example, the heron pipeline has A and B forks, representing the PCR 1 and
PCR 2 routes.

> [!TIP]
> - Note the use of &heron_filters and *heron_filters in the example below. This allows a filter to be share between two branches of the pipeline.
> - You are *strongly\* encouraged to use this approach when dealing with branched pipelines with identical filters. In the past there have been several occasions where failure to follow this pattern has resulted in a library type only getting added to one branch of the pipeline by mistake.

```yaml

    LHR-384 End Prep: LHR-384 AL Lib
    LHR-384 AL Lib: LHR-384 Lib PCR
Heron-384 B: # Heron 384-well pipeline specific to PCR 2 plate (uses above relationships after cDNA plate)

    LHR-384 PCR 2: LHR-384 cDNA
```

> [!TIP]
> The keys in the yaml must be unique, but the values need not be. In the example below two types of plate (Input and PCR XP) are able to lead into the Aggregate plate and will both display the suggested action to create that Aggregate child plate.
> In this example the Input and PCR XP are versions of the samples prepared to the same state (cleaned DNA ready for aggregation).
> The difference is one (the Input) is created by faculty off LIMS and created by a manifest, whereas the other (PCR XP) has been created from an earlier step within LIMS.

```yaml
  relationships:
    LRC GEM-X 5p cDNA Input: LRC GEM-X 5p Aggregate
    LRC GEM-X 5p cDNA PCR XP: LRC GEM-X 5p Aggregate
