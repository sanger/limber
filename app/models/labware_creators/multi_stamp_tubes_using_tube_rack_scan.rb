module LabwareCreators
  # Handles the creation of a plate from a number of tubes using an uploaded tube rack scan file.
  #
  # The parents are standard tubes.
  #
  # The user uploads a tube rack scan of the tube barcodes and their positions, and this creator will
  # transfer the tubes into wells on the plate.
  #
  # Inputs:
  # 1) A parent tube - the user has clicked the add plate button on a specific tube
  # 2) A tube rack scan CSV file - this is a scan of the rack of 2D tube barcodes (the rack is not being tracked)
  #
  # Outputs:
  # 1) A child plate - tubes are stamped into corresponding locations in the plate according to the scan file
  #
  # Validations - Error message to users if any of these are not met:
  # 1) The user must always upload a scan file. Validations of the file must pass and it should parse correctly and
  # contain at least one tube barcode.
  # 2) The tube barcodes must be unique within the file (exclude NO SCAN, NO READ types).
  # 3) The scanned child tube barcode(s) must already exist in the system. List any that do already exist with tube
  # barcode and scan file location.
  # 4) The labware purpose type of each tube must match the one of the expected ones from a list in the plate purpose
  # config. List any that do not match with tube barcode, scan file location and purpose type, and list the expected
  # type(s).
  # 5) The request on the tube must be active, and must match to one of the expected ones from a list in the plate
  # purpose config. This is to check that the tubes are at the appropriate stage of their pipeline to transfer.
  # 6) The source tube must not have an ean13 barcode, as the previous-tube validation step does not support this.
  # 7) The scan file must contain the tube that was scanned on the previous page. This is to check that the correct
  # file has been uploaded.
