module LabwareCreators
  # RebalancedPooledTube is a labware creator used in the Ultima pipeline, responsible for
  # creating a rebalanced pooled tube based on user-provided rebalancing data from a
  #
  # In this pipeline, the user needs to create a rebalanced pooled tube (UPF Balanced Pool Tube)
  # based on the output of a previous sequencing run. The rebalancing is
  # calculated from a CSV file provided by the user, which contains the
  # rebalancing variables per sample/tag index.
  #
  # This class extends {PooledTubesBySubmission}, since in Ultima:
  # - pooling is always one tube per submission
  # - aliquots in the tube are the samples that were in the submission
  #   sequenced in the previous run
  #
  # Workflow:
  # 1. User uploads the previous runâ€™s CSV file(downloaded from nexus platform).
  # 2. The CSV file is validated and parsed into rebalancing variables.
  # 3. For each aliquot in the rebalanced pooled tube, the calculated
  #    rebalancing variables are attached as poly_metadata.
  #
  # This will create the pooled tube and associate the calculated metadata
  # with its aliquots via the Sequencescape v2 API.
