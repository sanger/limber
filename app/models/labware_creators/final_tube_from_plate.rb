  # requested while libraries are still being made.
  # JG: We should check if there are other aspects of this that are depended on
  # This form is used to transfer directly from a plate into the final tubes.
  # The transfer template finds the mx tube corresponding to each well, and
  # transfers into it. As a result, pooling may happen at this stage.

  # The tubes are also passed automatically. This behaviour is a time-saving
  # (for the users) measure based on limitations of the existing pipeline, and
  # may be removed in future. Essentially, as used currently, the tubes are
  # ACTUALLY part of the previous plate, so are already filled by this stage.
