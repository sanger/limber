    # It is responsible for handling the transfer process, ensuring that the material
    # from the parent plate wells is correctly transferred to the corresponding child tubes.
    #
    # @note We allow users to create more than two tubes per well, by clicking the "Add Tube" button in the UI.
    #   In case the user mistakenly clicks the "Add Tube" button multiple times, we assume that the user would
    #   cancel the additional tubes through the UI, so we do not handle that case here. If in case we need to
    #   handle that case, we need to track down the relationship between the tubes and the wells with `TransferRequest`
    #   model, where we have the `source_asset` and `target_asset` attributes along with the state. Also, note that
    #   the `request_hash` contains the `outer_request` and for the 2 tubes created, the `outer_request` will be the
    #   same. Because of this, the user might not be able to see requests in the "Requests" tab of the SS UI for the
    #   second tube.

    #   wells based on the well state `!well.passed?`. However, because one of the plates where Kinnex starts
    #   is an input plate, the wells would not be in a passed state (in fact, their state would be 'unknown'),
