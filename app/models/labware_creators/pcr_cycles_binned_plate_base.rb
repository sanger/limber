module LabwareCreators
  # Handles the generation of a plate with wells binned according to the number of
  # PCR cycles that has been determined by the customer.
  # Uploads a file supplied by the customer that has a row per each well.
  # Uses the PCR Cycles column to determine the binning arrangement of the wells,
  # and the Sample Volume and Diluent Volume columns in the well transfers.
  # Values from some columns need to be stored for a later file export step downstream
  # in the pipeline.
  # Wells in the bins are applied to the destination by column order.
  # If there is enough space on the destination plate each new bin will start in a new
  # column. Otherwise bins will run consecutively without gaps.
