module LabwareCreators
  # Handles the creation of up to 2 child racks of tubes from a single parent 96-well plate.
  # Intended for use in a PBMC cell extraction pipeline.
  #
  # There will typically be one rack of tubes for 'contingency' and one for 'sequencing' (this rack is
  # optional).
  #
  # The parent plate contains multiple copies of material prepared from the same sample. One well instance
  # of each sample will go into a tube in the 'sequencing' rack (if present), and any remaining copies
  # will go into tubes in the 'contingency' rack.
  #
  # If after the initial preparation the users feel they need more contingency tubes, then they will go
  # back to prepare more material for that sample from an earlier step in the pipeline and create just
  # 'contingency' tubes at this step.
  #
  # Inputs:
  # 1) The parent plate - This plate contains multiple groups of wells containing the same samples e.g.
  #    there may be 3 wells with sample 1, 3 with sample 2, 3 with sample 3 etc. The number of copies of
  #    each sample is not known in advance.
  #    The first of these parent wells will be transferred into a tube in the 'sequencing' rack if it is
  #    present, and any remaining parent wells for the same sample will be transferred into tubes in the
  #    'contingency' rack.
  # 2) Child tube rack scan CSV files - these are scans of racks of 2D tube barcodes from the 'contingency'
  #    and 'sequencing' tube racks, to allow us to know the position and barcode of each available tube.
  #    On the upload screen displays counts of how many tubes are needed (e.g. To perform this transfer you
  #    will either need 20 sequencing and 40 contingency tubes, or 60 contingency tubes.)
  #
  # Validations - Error message to users if any of these are not met:
  # 1) The user must always upload a scan file for the 'contingency' rack tube barcodes, whereas the
  #    'sequencing' rack file is optional.
  # 2) The scanned child tube barcodes must be unique and must not already exist in the system i.e. they are
  #    new unused empty tubes. List any that do already exist with rack type and location.
  # 3) The number of tubes available in the racks must be correct for the number of parent wells being
  #    transferred. e.g. if there are 20 distinct samples in the parent and 40 additional copies (60 wells
  #    total), then there must be 20 tubes in the first rack and 40 in the second rack.
