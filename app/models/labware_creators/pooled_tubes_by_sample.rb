    # QUESTIONS:
    #
    # Should the request hash contain the submission uuid? -> Don't see why not, since we do have one.
    #
    # Should we pre-filter wells, based on whether they have been failed, or based on what request they have?
    #   -> Probably OK without - robot will be hard-coded to do a pattern of picking...
    #   -> Should check this general strategy with team, as labware creators are inconsistent.
    #
    # Does it matter we're inheriting include SupportParent::TaggedPlateOnly ?
    #
    # Should we set 'outer_request' in the request_hash? Implications of setting this, or submission, neither, or both?
