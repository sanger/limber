module LabwareCreators
  # This labware creator receives barcodes for a configured number of source
  # plates from the user. It pools samples from the passed wells into a
  # destination plate. It's used for scRNA Donor Pooling to create 'LRC PBMC
  # Pools' plates from 'LRC PBMC Defrost PBS' plates.
  #
  # The creator imposes restrictions:
  # - It doesn't allow combining samples from different studies or projects.
  # - It doesn't allow samples with the same donor_id in the same pool.
  # - All wells must have cell count data unless they are failed.
  # - The number of pools must not exceed the number configured for the samples.
  #
  # The number of pools is determined by a lookup table based on sample count.
  # Tag depth index is added to aliquot attributes to avoid tag clashes.
