module Presenters::Statemachine
  #
  # Presenters::Statemachine::Submission can be included in a class to provide
  # a state machine with the following behaviour:
  # - When plates are 'pending' the submission sidebar will be displayed.
  #   This sidebar allows the user to build a submission for the plate
  # - In all other states the default sidebar will be used
  # - When the plate is passed, the user will be allowed to create the child plates
  # - In all other states the user will be unable to advanced the plate
  #
  # Typically this state machine should be used in conjunction with an input
  # plate purpose. {file:docs/purposes_yaml_files.md See the purposes yaml configuration.}
  # Purposes with input_plate set to true use the PlatePurpose::Input class in sequencescape.
  # These plates show the following states:
  # Pending: No submission made, or some wells with samples have no submissions
  # Passed: Submissions made, and the plate is ready to proceed
  # Cancelled/Failed: Seen when all requests out of the plate have these states.
  #
  # Other states: Typically not seen in standard scenarios.
