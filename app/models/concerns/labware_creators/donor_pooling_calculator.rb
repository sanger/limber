  # b) the requested number of pools is specified at the study/project level,
  #    because different study/project groups could be from different customers.
  #
  # Wells are grouped based on the study and project of the first aliquot in each well
  # (only one aliquot is expected per well). Returns an array of groups, where each group
  # is an array of wells with the same study and project.
