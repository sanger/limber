  # In the LTHR pipeline we begin with 4x96 well plates, which get combined
  # on a single 384 well plate. This means that the cross-plate pool detection
  # enforces unique UDI plates. This causes problems if a tag plate is used in
  # error, and there needs to be a rework loop. As on the second run through,
  # tag clash detection fires.
  #
  # By setting the disable_cross_plate_pool_detection config option you can
  # turn off this check.
  #
  # @note This option is safest to enable when:
  #       - The pipeline has an earlier consolidation step
  #       - The pipeline will never pool at a higher level than the current late
  #       - Only one template is available anyway
  #       In other scenarios you may be at risk of introducing tag clashes.
