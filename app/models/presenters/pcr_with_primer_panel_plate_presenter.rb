module Presenters
  # This Presenter shows the PCR primer panel on the left along with the standard plate layout
  # view and summary information. This version allows you to fail wells on the plate.
  #
  # This was specifically requested by the lab team for the GBS pipleine PCR1 plate so they
  # could fail wells. If well failing functionality was allowed on stock plates in future, that would be a
  # preferable option for them and they could fail the wells on the parent plate, and the PCR1 plate could
  # be returned to using the MinimalPcrPlatePresenter.
