# frozen_string_literal: true

# This label class provides attributes for Bioscan 384-well plate labels,
# which have only a single sticker. The placement of barcode and text fields
# is similar to 96-well plate labels. Note that other 384-well plate labels
# have double stickers.
#
# The label contains a barcode image in the middle and text on the corners.
# * The barcode image in the middle contains human barcode in code128, which
#   is more compact and readable than code39. It needs empty space on both
#   sides for readabilty.
# * Top-left contains date of printing
# * Bottom-left contains human barcode of the plate
# * Top-right contains the barcode of the an ancestor stock plate. For Bioscan
#   384-well plates, we show the first LILYS barcode, or the first LYSATE
#   barcode; not last.
#
# We show an ancestor stock plate barcode; not the parent. The algorithm
# below is generic to handle the cases when ancestor plates with the same
# purpose can be stock plates or non stock plates because of alternative
# pipeline paths and/or when ancestor plates from different paths are used
# together to make a plate. We show the first of the configured alternative
# or the first of closest stock plate ancestors.
#
# Only Squix printers are used for printing 384-well plate labels. We do not
# send print requests to PMB service, instead we send them directly to SPrint
# service, which talks to Squix printers.
