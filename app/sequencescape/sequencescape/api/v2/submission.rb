  # and we'll see them jump straight from pending to built. However this can
  # probably be considered a bug so lets handle both states here to avoid
  # unpleasant side effects in future.
  # We also have a 'ready_buffer', an optional argument which tells us to treat
  # anything that completed more recently than the ready_buffer as still pending.
  # This lets us handle some race conditions that can occur.
