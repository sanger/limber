  # This is our best attempt at mimicking the equivalent aliquot behaviour
  # over in Sequencescape Aliquot::equivalent_attributes
  # We use a smaller subset of attributes here, to avoid sending everything over
  # the api. In future we could consider:
  # 1. Sending over all attributes
  # 2. Hashing the attributes sequencescape side and sending that over.
  # But for the moment this will suffice, as in practice existing process
  # should ensure that these values are sufficient.
  # In the event these assumptions are violated, Sequencescape will still prevent
  # the transfer, it just wont be as user-friendly.
