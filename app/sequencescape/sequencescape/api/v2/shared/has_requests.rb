    # We pre-filter cancelled requests as we tend to treat them as though they never existed
    # We then prioritise any in progress requests over those which have passed.

    # rare circumstances. We warn the user if they are trying to do this.
    # @note Plate has its own active_requests method which overrides this one and
    #       works out active requests on a per-well basis.
