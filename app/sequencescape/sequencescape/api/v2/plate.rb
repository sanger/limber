  # Active requests are determined on a per-well level
  # This is to maintain pre-existing behaviour. What this means:
  # In progress requests (those not passed or failed) take precedence over
  # those which are passed/failed.
  # Currently: This happens on a per-well level, which means if well A1
  # only has completed requests, and yet B1 has in-progress requests out of
  # it, then both A1s completed requests, and B1s in progress requests will
  # be listed.
  # Alternatively: Remove this and even a single in progress request for
  # any well will take precedence. In theory this probably makes more sense
  # but in practice we tend to operate on the plate as a whole.
