   * 1 - Vue needs to compile the template (ie. our HTML) on the fly
   #     which means we import a different version of vue above.
   #     import Vue from 'vue/dist/vue.esm'
   #     This is slower, and generally recommended against.
   # 2 - Things didn't appear to be as straight forward as I
   #     had hoped. I *think* this was because I began wrestling
   #     vue's expectations with regards to single page applications
   # 3 - Vue does NOT like our existing templates. The script tags
   #     seem to upset it.
   # In general it looks like this is something we should consider
   # once the majority of our components are vue based.
