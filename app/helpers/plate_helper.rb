  # Returns an array of all pre-capture pools for a plate, with wells sorted
  # into plate well column order. We rely on the fact that hashes maintain
  # insert order, and walk the wells in column order. Each time we see a
  # pre-capture pool for the first time, it gets inserted into the hash along
  # with the request Order id.
  # We then sort the pre-capture pool hashes within the array by their Order
  # ids, to get the pools into the right sequence. Requests are grouped into
  # Orders, each pre-capture pool has a different Order relating to the asset
  # group name entered on the submission manifest. Asset groups are created in
  # the sequence they are presented in the manifest. (Pre-capture pools are not
  # created sequentially in the same order as the asset groups on the manifest).
  # This sorted array gets passed to our javascript via ajax.
  # @note Javascript objects are not explicitly ordered, hence the need to pass
  # an array here.
