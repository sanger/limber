# This is the pipeline configuration for Bioscan Lysate preparation.
# This automated route involves a Beckman robot removing Ethanol from insects in
# the LILYS-96 Stock plate wells, then adding Lysis buffer, then transferring the lysed material
# and adding controls into the destination LBSN-96 Lysate plate.
