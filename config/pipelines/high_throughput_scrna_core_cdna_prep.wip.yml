    # TODO: do we need to allow skipping or bypassing the Aggregate plate? Config allows for a 2-step
    # aggregation process, but this is not always necessary depending on the number of samples
    # selected from the source plates. i.e. if 10 or fewer source plates are needed you could make the
    # cherrypick plate directly from the source plates.
